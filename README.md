# Speed Typing Python App (Console-Based)

This is a simple typing speed test application developed using Python. It is a console-based project that checks how fast and accurately a user can type a given sentence.

## Features

- Displays a random sentence for the user to type  
- Calculates typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)  
- Measures time taken to complete typing  
- Compares the user's input with the original sentence  
- Shows accuracy percentage

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- time module  
- random module  
- String comparison and logic  

## How It Works

1. A sentence is randomly selected from a list.
2. The user is asked to type it.
3. The application measures the time taken.
4. It calculates typing speed and accuracy.
5. Results are displayed after typing is completed.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Sashi09/typer-app
   cd typer-app
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

Run the Python script using:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python typer.py
A random sentence will appear. Type it as fast and accurately as you can.

After completion, the program will display:
Time taken

Words per minute (WPM)

Accuracy percentage
Sample Output

Edit
Type this:
Python is a great programming language

Start typing:
> Python is a grat programming languge

Time Taken: 12.5 seconds  
Words Per Minute: 26.4 WPM  
Accuracy: 88%
Purpose
This project was done as part of my Python practice. It helped me understand how to use logic, basic modules, and measure typing performance in a console-based application.
